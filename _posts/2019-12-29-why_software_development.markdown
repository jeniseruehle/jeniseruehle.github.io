I am an insatiably curious soul, I have always loved puzzles, problem solving, and figuring out how and why things work. Over the past few years I began to really appreciate my knack for research, learning and my true love and instinct for technology - because of this I realized I really needed a career path that incorporated both my skillset and my passion.

Like many, my first foray into coding was working with HTML to make my MySpace page look cool. Once I started to really learn the language, I was overcome with the excitement of how it worked like magic on my screen. I also knew this was a real passion because I grew up in the country in the days of dial-up internet access and was willing to wait several minutes for each of my changes to load. So when I went to college, I decided to major in Computer Science. I spent my first two years taking courses but unfortunately, at that age I was not prepared and decided to switch majors my Junior year. I still continued to build layouts and websites in my free time.

Since college I have worked in several different industries but have always been drawn back to coding. I first came across the concept of a Web Development bootcamp in 2015. Naturally, I did massive amounts of research and kept searching for the perfect bootcamp, at the right price and time. Somehow this year, the stars aligned and I found Flatiron School. In early November, after feeling pretty certain about wanting to attend Flatiron, I began working my way through the bootcamp prep. I loved it and felt the same excitement and magic I did the first time I manipulated my Myspace page. I had my interview and was accepted the day before Thanksgiving!

Now here I am, working my way through Ruby and I am still just as excited and amazed every time I complete a lesson. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow with the program.
