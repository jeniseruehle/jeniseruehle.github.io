For my javascript project, I decided to build a wedding checklist app to help plan the big day! 

When I got married 3 years ago, I was warned about how stressful it would be and what things could go wrong but to my surprise planning our wedding  was actually a really fun process (probably because I am someone who loves planning, checklists, and organizing... it also didn't hurt that I had some experience in event planning lol.) 

The one thing that really kept me and hubby on track was a planner and checklist with everything that had to be done and by when and it kept us sane and on top of everything.  And because we were so organized, our wedding day was absolutely enjoyable. The biggest worry I had was hoping I didn't trip walking down the aisle LOL.

So for my app, users are able to create "to-dues" which are items displayed in the form of tiles that have a title, a description, a due date, and a list tag. These items are organized by due date - with the most upcoming due date displayed first. 

Users are also able to view each item in their list tag groups by using a filtered dropdown. And finally users are able to delete any list item by clicking the delete button.
