I almost cannot believe I'm writing this today - I am finally here, the final portfolio project. I struggled a lot with JavaScript live coding, so much so, that I was afraid that I would not be able to complete React/Redux coursework and build the final project on time!

For my final project, I wanted to expand on my earlier Rails app, AstroMonthly - and after some brainstorming, <b>AstroDaily</b> was born. AstroDaily is an app for astrologers and astrology enthusiasts to track and journal about their experiences during different planetary transits. Right now, it includes transits of the Sun, Moon, & Mercury (but will expand to include Venus, Mars, Jupiter, & Saturn - the app will not include the outer planets mainly because their transits are slow that it they take 80+ years or more to complete a full cycle around the Sun - meaning those planets can stick around in a area of the natal chart for a while making it harder for those experiences to make themselves fully realized and are usually more visible on a societal/generational level).

Building this project was daunting but my passion for the subject also made working on it fun and kept me motivated - I now realize why it's beneficial to work on something you love, it can definitely keep you going even through the rough patches!

The majority of my issues/bugs were easily solved by reviewing lessons I'd bookmarked and a lot of research time on Google. I actually really enjoy solving the issues that arise, spending time tracking down a problem and finally getting it to work OR knowing when to prioritize the project requirements vs my stretch goals. Out of all the things to give me the most trouble I did not expect it to mostly be the design aspects, CSS/Bootstrap. One of my biggest headaches happened to be trying to work with Bootstrap - I never used it on any other projects so it was a bit of a learning curve, especially installing it. If anyone else doesn't know yet - <b>Bootstrap v5</b> does not, I repeat <b>*DOES NOT*</b>, work with ReactJs (even though you can install it) - you should use Bootstrap v4.6 to save yourself time and stress. 

Once I finally figured out it was the version that was keeping my designs from rendering (oh and a little typo, `classname`should always be `className`), so much of the design became easier to work with and change when necessary. There's still a few things I'll continue to try to figure out (i.e. how to resize tables and input forms to not span the entire page) but it made so much of the basic layout look exactly how I envisioned it. I plan to continue expanding AstroDaily - maybe incorporating user functionality after I meet some of the other stretch goals I have planned. 

I still am a little in shock that this journey is coming to a close, it has been such a major part of my life for almost 2 years - there were so many times I wanted to quit and give up. This program has helped to regenerate my faith in myself and my ability to do hard things. As challenging as it has been, it also has been equally rewarding and I am so happy I made this decision and stuck with it. I came into this program needing to change things - I was fresh off of a pretty traumatic work experience, starting a new job, moving across country, volunteering to learn and help complete a major fiber optic installation (part of a two person team that spliced 1700+ fiber strands, connected them all, and now beginning to test!)... all during a global health pandemic and the upheaval of America in general.

I am very excited for what the future holds and to see what else I can accomplish! :)
